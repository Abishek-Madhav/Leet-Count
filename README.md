# Leet-Count
Developed a web extension that tracks and displays the number of problems solved in each topic on LeetCode

Why Leet-Count?

Leet-Count provides a better way to track problem-solving progress by displaying a breakdown of solved problems by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) for each topic. It replaces the default problem count with detailed stats on how many problems you've completed, including both locked and unlocked problems. This feature encourages a balanced approach, ensuring you donâ€™t linger on one difficulty for too long and motivates you to tackle the next challenge. By offering real-time insights, it helps maintain a steady pace of improvement across different problem levels.

Usage Instructions:

1) Click on any problem tag (e.g., Array, Strings) in LeetCode.
2) After the tag page loads, the solved problem count for each difficulty will appear within 10 seconds.

Issues:

Currently, the extension displays solved count stats within 10 seconds. However, if your network is slow or the page takes longer than 10 seconds to load, the stats may not appear. In such cases, simply refresh the page and try again. Future updates may address this issue.
